# eCommerce Application

## Introduction
This is an eCommerce application designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users. It includes features such as user authentication, product browsing, rating and reviewing, and admin functionalities for managing products and users. This is my first website project and it was very hard. I hope it would pelease the users.

## Why These Choices?

### Programming Language
I chose **Flask** because I was a little bit familiar with it because of my final project group members. The backend partis flask in our final project. Hence, I thought at least I am familiar with this language. However, it was very bad choice because vercel deployment could not be established. I chose **Next.js** for the frontend part because my researchs show that vercel deployment would be easier with it.



## Future Improvements
- Implementing a registeration page.

### Vercel Url
I do not have working vercel deployment url but I will share the link for you anyways. I hope this won't effect the grading too much:
