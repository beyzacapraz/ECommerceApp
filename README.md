# eCommerce Application

## Introduction
This is an eCommerce application designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users. It includes features such as user authentication, product browsing, rating and reviewing, and admin functionalities for managing products and users. This is my first website project, and it was very challenging. I hope it will please the users.

## Why These Choices?

### Programming Language
I chose **Flask** because I was somewhat familiar with it thanks to my final project group members. The backend of our final project was also built using Flask, so I felt more comfortable using it.  
However, it turned out to be a difficult choice because I couldn't establish a proper Vercel deployment with Flask first.

I chose **Next.js** for the frontend because my research showed that deploying with Vercel would be much easier using it.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing a registration page

## Vercel URL
Because Vercel is primarily for frontend (Next.js) projects. So I could not directly deploy Flask on Vercel. Instead, I have deployed my Flask backend on a backend-friendly service like: Render!
It gave me a public URL: https://ecommerceapp-3ntu.onrender.com/  and I have set the environment variable in Vercel: Here is the link:
ðŸ‘‰ [https://e-commerce-app-flax-ten.vercel.app/](https://e-commerce-app-flax-ten.vercel.app/)
